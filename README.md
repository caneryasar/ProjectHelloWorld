# üéÆ 3D Platformer Technology Demo ‚Äì Unity (Master's Project)

This repository contains a technology demo developed using the Unity game engine as a part of the Master's Degree Graduation Project at Hacettepe University, Computer Animation and Game Technologies program.

The project demonstrates a modular, extensible, and performance-optimized third-person 3D platformer framework featuring core gameplay mechanics, enemy AI, animation systems, and UI integration‚Äîbuilt using modern development principles and Unity's latest tools.

## üß† Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore and implement the core mechanics of a 3D platformer game, emphasizing:
- Hands-on application of Unity technologies
- Strong modular code architecture
- Reusable gameplay systems (e.g., event system, enemy AI, state machines)
- A polished player experience through responsive controls and animations

This demo serves as both a learning exercise and a foundational framework for future game projects.

## üîë Key Features

### üßç Player Mechanics
- Third-person controller using `CharacterController`
- Walk, run, jump, **double jump**, and **dash**
- Smooth camera with Cinemachine
- Input management with Unity's New Input System

### ü§ñ Enemy AI
- Hierarchical enemy control system using parent/child structure
- State machine-based AI with states for idle, chase, attack, etc.
- Visual feedback via world-space UI indicators (status, health)

### ‚öîÔ∏è Combat System
- Melee combat interactions
- Event-driven system to broadcast and react to in-game events
- Health tracking for enemies and player

### üì∫ UI & Feedback
- World-space and screen-space canvases
- Dynamic health bars and focus indicators
- Responsive player feedback through animation and VFX

### üéûÔ∏è Animations
- Unity Mecanim system with layered animation blending
- Player and enemy animations controlled via parameter-driven state transitions
